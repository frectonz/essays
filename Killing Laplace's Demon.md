# Killing Laplace's Demon

## Introduction

What are we really doing with this science thing?

When we observe some phenomenon, we try to explain it. After that, we transform our initial guess explanation into a testable hypothesis. Then we test our hypothesis using an experiment. If our hypothesis passes the test then it is considered a model of the phenomena we observed.

Over time as we ask more questions about the phenomena our model gets more and more complicated. This happens as some things are replaced and others are removed from our model or maybe we discover that the phenomena are just a side effect of a larger process going on in the background that we weren’t able to observe with our previous knowledge only with our newly acquired understandings are we able to observe and question this new phenomenon. 

Living in this universe is like being locked in a room while being blind and crippled and not knowing how we got here, we are just trying to understand our situation. Maybe we try to make a model of the room we’re in using ping pong balls. We can do this by throwing a bunch of ping pong balls in every direction and looking at which ones bounce and come back. But this can go wrong in many ways maybe we didn’t throw the ping pong balls far enough to bounce off the wall maybe we forgot to through one in a specific direction.


In case it wasn’t clear the room is the universe, and the balls are logical questions that help us model our universe.

But some scientists question the objectivity of this model of our universe. Are these models we developed really defining the objective reality of the universe? Or Are they describing our (humans) view of the universe? For example

> “It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about Nature” – Neils Bohr

Neils Bohr insisted that what we actually model is the results of observations, not the world.

The question of the objectivity of our models of the universe arises when we try to predict the outcomes of events. Because if these models don’t really describe reality then we have no reason to believe the predictions generated using these models, would in any way be analogous to the ones observed in reality.

As some scientists question the objectivity of reality others are confident in the fact that the universe is objective. They say that the universe is just a state that evolves over time using the laws of physics which is true to the extent of our current understanding of the universe. 

Our laws of nature are just models of the real thing. But we test these models based on how well they predict the next state of the thing they are describing. So if we tested these models of reality based on how well they predict the future. Then what we get at the end is an optimized way of telling the objective future.

Then what we are really doing with this thing we call science is looking through the veils of time to catch a glimpse into the future.

## Determinism

This is not as wired as you think let’s take a look at free-falling bodies, since Galileo Galilei’s discovery that all objects fall to the earth at the same rate we have created formulas with different levels of accuracy that tell us the position of a free falling body at any given time. In today’s world, we depend on our ability to predict the future in many avenues of life. For example, this model of a free-falling body is used in gravity simulation for games and for predicting the motion of spacecraft in continuous orbit.

To predict the motion of a free-falling body all we need to know is the initial height of the ball from the surface of the earth and its momentum using these two pieces of information we can calculate the state of the ball at any time in the future or the past.

For example if the position of a free falling body is 2m above the surface of the earth and its velocity is 0 m/s at t = 0s. We can calculate what its position and velocity will be at t = 3s using the formulawhich as we can see, doesn’t depend on the mass of the object because it is in free fall. So the position and velocity at t = 3s is 45 m and 30 m/s respectively. But the kicker here is that we can ask what was happening at t = -2s. Which is 20 m above the initial height of the earth and velocity of -20 m/s.

Let’s talk some history to gain some perspective on this thing.

After **Isaac Newton** had published *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in which he formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, people started to realize that this model can be used to calculate the evolution of the position of every particle in the universe. One of the people that came to this realization was **Pierre-Simon Laplace** who introduced a thought experiment to the world in his book *A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities* by stating the following:

> “We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes”

The intellect described in this thought experiment is commonly called **Laplace’s Demon**.

What Laplace is trying to explain here is that according to the physics of his time which is classical physics centered around Newton’s laws of motion. If you could collect the state of every particle in the universe and you had enough computation power to analyze (using the models of the universe we previously talked about) the data you collected then the past, the future, and everything in between is no longer uncertain because as we saw in the previous example you can turn the dials of time to the extent of your will to see what happened in the past or **what is going to happen** in the future. If you were able to achieve this then time will no longer be a restriction. It would just merely be another variable in your equation.

Note that I said, “**what is going to happen**". You might have sensed a bit of certainty in that statement. In this model of the universe, the universe is void of any uncertainty meaning that if you consider a particle moving through a vacuum its position and its momentum are always known at any point in time. Some of you might be saying what about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, we will get to it.

When you combine this with the law of conservation of mass and the law of conservation of energy. The universe can be considered a completely adiabatic system in which nothing happening outside it can influence what happens inside it. Anything that exists now existed in some form since the beginning of the universe. You might have heard this before when people say that the oxygen that is today essential to life on our planet was formed in an extreme condition caused by dying stars or supernova.


This view of the universe is called **determinism**.

This can also be called a **clockwork universe** in which the universe is considered a perfect machine much like a mechanical clock whose gears are governed by the laws of physics thus making every part of the system predictable.

There are a lot of interesting questions that arise when discussing this topic.

- Can you fit all of the information in the universe into a region less than the universe?
- Can you make a computer that can compute the universe while itself being part of that universe?
