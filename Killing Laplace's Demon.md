# Killing Laplace's Demon

## Introduction

What are we really doing with this science thing?

When we observe some phenomenon, we try to explain it. After that, we transform our initial guess explanation into a testable hypothesis. Then we test our hypothesis using an experiment. If our hypothesis passes the test then it is considered a model of the phenomena we observed.

Over time as we ask more questions about the phenomena our model gets more and more complicated. This happens as some things are replaced and others are removed from our model or maybe we discover that the phenomena are just a side effect of a larger process going on in the background that we weren’t able to observe with our previous knowledge only with our newly acquired understandings are we able to observe and question this new phenomenon. 

Living in this universe is like being locked in a room while being blind and crippled and not knowing how we got here, we are just trying to understand our situation. Maybe we try to make a model of the room we’re in using ping pong balls. We can do this by throwing a bunch of ping pong balls in every direction and looking at which ones bounce and come back. But this can go wrong in many ways maybe we didn’t throw the ping pong balls far enough to bounce off the wall maybe we forgot to through one in a specific direction.


In case it wasn’t clear the room is the universe, and the balls are logical questions that help us model our universe.

But some scientists question the objectivity of this model of our universe. Are these models we developed really defining the objective reality of the universe? Or Are they describing our (humans) view of the universe? For example

> “It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about Nature” – Neils Bohr

Neils Bohr insisted that what we actually model is the results of observations, not the world.

The question of the objectivity of our models of the universe arises when we try to predict the outcomes of events. Because if these models don’t really describe reality then we have no reason to believe the predictions generated using these models, would in any way be analogous to the ones observed in reality.

As some scientists question the objectivity of reality others are confident in the fact that the universe is objective. They say that the universe is just a state that evolves over time using the laws of physics which is true to the extent of our current understanding of the universe. 

Our laws of nature are just models of the real thing. But we test these models based on how well they predict the next state of the thing they are describing. So if we tested these models of reality based on how well they predict the future. Then what we get at the end is an optimized way of telling the objective future.

Then what we are really doing with this thing we call science is looking through the veils of time to catch a glimpse into the future.

## Determinism

This is not as weird as you might think. Let’s take a look at free-falling bodies, since Galileo Galilei’s discovery that all objects fall to the earth at the same rate we have created formulas with different levels of accuracy that tell us the position of a free falling body at any given time. In today’s world, we depend on our ability to predict the future in many avenues of life. For example, this model of a free-falling body is used in gravity simulation for games and for predicting the motion of spacecraft in continuous orbit.

To predict the motion of a free-falling body all we need to know is the initial height of the ball from the surface of the earth and its initial velocity using these two pieces of information we can calculate the state of the ball at any time in the future or the past.

For example if the position of a free falling body is `2 m` above the surface of the earth and its velocity is `0 m/s` at `t = 0s`. We can calculate what its position and velocity will be at `t = 3s` using the formulas `h(t) = 1/2(g(t^2))` and `v(t) = gt` which as we can see, doesn’t depend on the mass of the object because it is in free fall. So the position and velocity at `t = 3s` is `45 m` and `30 m/s` respectively. But the kicker here is that we can ask what was happening at `t = -2s`. Which is `20 m` above the initial height of the earth and velocity of `-20 m/s`.

## Origins

After **Isaac Newton** had published *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in which he formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, people started to realize that this model can be used to calculate the evolution of the position of every particle in the universe. One of the people that came to this realization was **Pierre-Simon Laplace** who introduced a thought experiment to the world in his book *A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities* by stating the following:

> “We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes”

The intellect described in this thought experiment is commonly called **Laplace’s Demon**.

What Laplace is trying to explain here is that according to the physics of his time which is classical physics centered around Newton’s laws of motion. If you could collect the state of every particle in the universe and you had enough computation power to analyze (using the models of the universe we previously talked about) the data you collected then the past, the future, and everything in between is no longer uncertain because as we saw in the previous example you can turn the dials of time to the extent of your will to see what happened in the past or **what is going to happen** in the future. If you were able to achieve this then time will no longer be a restriction. It would just merely be another variable in your equation.

Note that I said, “**what is going to happen**". You might have sensed a bit of certainty in that statement. In this model of the universe, the universe is void of any uncertainty meaning that if you consider a particle moving through a vacuum its position and its momentum are always known at any point in time. Some of you might be saying what about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, we will get to it.

When you combine this with the law of conservation of mass and the law of conservation of energy. The universe can be considered a completely adiabatic system in which nothing happening outside it can influence what happens inside it. Anything that exists now existed in some form since the beginning of the universe. You might have heard this before when people say that the oxygen that is today essential to life on our planet was formed in an extreme condition caused by dying stars or supernova.


This view of the universe is called **determinism**.

This can also be called a **clockwork universe** in which the universe is considered a perfect machine much like a mechanical clock whose gears are governed by the laws of physics thus making every part of the system predictable.

## The Implications

There are a lot of interesting questions that arise when discussing this topic.

* Can you fit all of the information in the universe into a region less than the universe?
* Can you make a computer that can compute the universe while itself being part of that universe?
*  How much energy would this computer need?

We will not discuss this question instead, we are going to look at the physical models of reality that we have today to test if they allow this kind computer or being to exist. We will be discussing the question **Can Laplace’s Demon Exist?**.

The most harsh and possibly dangerous truth that arises when discussing determinism is, anything we humans do in this life doesn't matter. We aren't independent actors writing our own story instead we are all actors playing the roles nature wrote for us. This means all the bad things tha happen in life were meant to happen and we can't stop them. Murders will not be guilty because they were meant to kill. People will not be responsible for their actions.

Oedipus was meant to kill his father and marry his mother. A deterministic universe has no place for **Free Will**. Now that we know what's on the line if Laplace's Demon exists, let's see some arguments against Laplace's Demon.

## The Beasts

Laplace's Demon will face three beasts that hopefully by the end of this essay will kill Laplace's Demon.

1. Chaos Theory
2. Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
3. Black Hole Evaporation (Hawking Radiation)

### Chaos Theory

One of the many arguments against the possibility of the existence of Laplace’s Demon is **Chaos Theory**.

Chaos Theory deals with the major changes that result from minor changes in the initial state of a deterministic system. This is commonly described using the metaphor called the *Butterfly Effect* which states that A butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could cause a tornado in Texas. This theory states that small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to errors in measurements or due to rounding errors in computation can yield widely diverging results in the following states.

The thing about measurement is that you are always restricted by your measuring device. If you are going to measure the length of some line and you are using a regular ruler then you would be limited by the ruler’s scale so if you get a measurement of something like `2.1 cm` then there is an implicit uncertainty of `1 mm` in your measurement. Even if you use a laser beam to measure the length of the line, you would be restricted by the wavelength of light.

We can always minimize the uncertainty in our measurement using a more accurate measuring device but we can never get rid of it. In order for Laplace’s Demon to exist it needs to be able to collect each and every particle’s position and momentum to infinite precision but that is not possible. Even if the universe is deterministic Laplace’s Demon wouldn’t be able to predict the future until the end of time or look back to the past until the beginning of time. After some steps of the evolution of the particles in the universe the butterfly effect creeps into our computation and disturbs our ability to predict.

Chaos theory doesn’t completely rule out the possibility of Laplace’s Demon it merely puts limits on its sight of the future and the past. Chaos theory is like a fog that sets in when we look too far into the future or too far back to the past. Chaos theory tells us that even if the universe is deterministic we can’t look at all time at the same time.

The effects of chaos theory is quiet predictable when you consider the inherent inaccuracy in measurements that is every measurement has an uncertainty of some kind. For example if we are predicting what the area of a square will be if we square its sides. If our initial state is `2.4 cm` when measured using a ruler of uncertainty `1 mm`. This means that our measurement is somewhere between `2.39 cm` to `2.41 cm`. We will get the following

```
initial state = 2.4 ± 0.01 cm = 2.4 ± 0.42%
1st evolution = (2.4 ± 0.42%)2 = 5.76 ± 0.84%
2st evolution = (5.76 ± 0.84%)2 = 33.1776 ± 1.68%
3st evolution = (33.1776 ± 1.68%)2 = 1,100.75314176 ± 3.36%
```

When we continue evolving the state the uncertainties get bigger and bigger making our predictions less and less dependable.

### Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

The next beast Laplace’s Demon has to face is the beast of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, which states that you can’t measure both the position and momentum (velocity) of a particle exactly.

I realize that through out this essay i have been referring to **some particles** the reason forthis ambiguity is, throughout history as this deterministic view of our universe evolved. Scientists have been learning a lot about the fundamental particles of nature. Because of this different scientists that worked on this problem used the word particle to mean different things. Before modern particle physics the particles that were referred to might have been some sort indivisible small material or materials that constitute everything in the universe. In modern science thy are the particles of the standard model. The **Standard Model** of particle physics is the theory describing **three of the four known fundamental forces** in the universe and **twelve elementary particles**. Gravity remains unexplained by this model. If you are talking about determinism in terms of the standard model, you are asking if the interactions between the fundamental forces and the elementary particles are unpredictable or random in anyway. Some say that even the standard model is not fundamental enough by pointing to its shortcomings in explaining gravity. In Laplace’s Demon there is an implicit assumption that the most fundamental thing that constitutes everything in the universe is some sort of particle, but there are other modern theories of everything or theories of determinism that consider other things as fundamental. For example in **string theory** the most fundamental things from which everything is made up from are *infinitesimal vibrating strings*, there are also some theories that that propose that the most fundamental thing in the universe is **binary information** (**1s** and **0s**). In this essay I have been using the word particle to mean the most fundamental thing in the theory we are discussing. In this specific case we are considering the elementary particles of the standard model mainly the electron.

This beast tries to disadvantage Laplace’s Demon by affecting its power to observe. In any form of seeing whether it is using (light, sound or something else) some wave or particle has to propagate through the space between the observer and the subject and then bounce of the surface of the subject to get back to the observer at which point the observer can note which ones came back and use that to form an image. Here you should realize that the source of illumination doesn’t necessarily have to begin its trajectory from the observer. That is the particle or wave we are using doesn’t necessarily have to originate from the observer.

Let’s see an example, when you are seeing something a light source whether it is the sun or simply a torch light illuminates the subject you are observing with photons these photos start their journey from the light source, travel through space between the light source and subject. After that they hit the subject, the photons bounce back in each and every different directions and some get into your eyes and form an image.

Observing although commonly not thought of us a physical process, has side effects on the physical universe. Meaning that if the subject you are observing is small enough to be affected by the particle or the wave your observation mechanism is using then it will be. Observation is snapshot of the state of the subject before the effects of the observation take place. Observation alter the state of the subject.

If we are using light waves to the observe the position of an electron then that electron’s velocity will be affected by the observation because a photon just collided with which means its observed state is out of sync with the state it is in the real world. If we had known the velocity of the electron before the collision then we don’t know now.

In order to observe something as small us an electron, we need a light with a very small wavelength. When we decrease the wavelength of a light then we are inadvertently going to increase the frequency. The higher your frequency the more energetic the wave is. Due to this our light will have more energy. This will cause the electron’s velocity to be even more greatly affected. The more accurately we try to observer the position of a particle (i.e by decreasing the wavelength) the more the velocity of the particle is affected making our knowledge of its velocity less accurate.

Heisenberg was able to realize this fundamental limit on observation set by nature. He found the limit for this inaccuracy to be plank’s constant divided by the mass of the particle. Laplace’s Demon needs knowledge over every particle’s position and momentum (i.e is mass times velocity) to do its predictions but Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle has taken that away.

Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle has gored out Laplace’s Demon's eyes making it incapable of total knowledge. Making it impossible to know the position and momentum of every particle in the universe.

There are two arguments that suport the legitimacy of Laplace’s Demon.

Argument number one is even if Laplace’s Demon is not able to record the position and momentum of every particle in the universe, it can still generate a random initial state and evolve that state to see where it goes. Although this will mean that Laplace’s Demon will not be able to look at the past and the future of our universe at the same It will however be able to see the past and the future of the universe that originates from the random state it generated. This is all to mean that even if Laplace’s Demon is not able to simulate our universe it will be able to simulate a universe the evolves from its own initial arbitrary random state.

Argument number two is to that we are not sure if electrons are the most fundamental thing. In order to simulate a system you need to know what the most fundamental pieces of that system that make it work. For example in string theory the most fundamental things in universe are infinitesimal vibrating strings. According some scientists the most fundamental thing in the universe is **information**. We will cover these ideas another time.

This is the origin of one of Albert Einstein’s famous quote “God doesn’t play dice with the universe”. Which illustrates the frustrations many scientists have with uncertainty. Einstein was a proponent of Laplacian determinism. Einstein thought that the uncertainty we observe is because of our view of the universe. He thought that the underlying reality of the universe as perceived through a power such as God (which he meant to say an omnipotent being outside of the universe that is able to see into the universe) would have no place for uncertainty.

-- Talk about the wave function
The wave function contains all that one can know of the particle, both its position, and its speed. If you know the wave function at one time, then its values at other times are determined by what is called the Schroedinger equation. Thus one still has a kind of determinism, but it is not the sort that Laplace envisaged. Instead of being able to predict the positions and speeds of particles, all we can predict is the wave function. This means that we can predict just half what we could, according to the classical 19th century view.

Laplace’s Demon has been badly wounded after its face down with Chaos Theory and Heisenberg’s  Uncertainty Principle.

Chaos Theory took its ability to have infinite knowledge. It also draw curtains of ambiguity thereby limiting Laplace's Demon’s ability to see into the past and the future without bounds. 

And now Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle has made Laplace's Demon incapable of observing (with any level of certainty) the position and momentum of every particle in the universe. The only thing Laplace’s Demon can do now is look at small chunks of the past and the future of a universe that has evolved from an initial configuration determined by it self. Laplace's Demon is now unable to simulate the universe it exists in.

The final beast Laplace’s Demon has to face is Black Hole Radiation. Let’s see if this is the last argument against Laplace’s Demon’s plea for existence.

### Black Hole Evaporation (Hawking Radiation)

A black hole is a celestial structure with a very strong gravitational field such that anything that falls into it would not be able to escape. This structure is very dense, having a large amount of mass while having a very small volume.

Laplace himself wrote a paper in 1799 describing a gravitational field of a star could bes so strong that light it self couldn't escape its hold. Before Laplace wrote his paper a scientist called John Mitchell wrote about this phenomenon. At this light was considered to have been made up of small particles called corpuscles. In 1887 Michelson and Morley carried out an experiment that light always travelled at a speed of `300,000 km/s` independent of its origins. This disproved the theory that light could be slowed down by a strong gravitational field. Everything changed in 1915 when Einstein published his revolutionary paper on **General Theory of Relativity**. In General Relativity space and time are not separate entities they were just two direction in a single object called space-time. In this model space-time is not flat it is curved and warped by the matter and energy in it. Matter curves space-time and this curvature is explained to be Gravity. In General Relativity everything follows a striaght line in the fabric of space-time. Therefore when an object of some mass curves space-time everything meaning light, moons, stars, planets or some other object follows the path formed by the curvature. In 1919 General Relativity was proven to be correct by observing the shift of light that was caused by the curved space-time around sun.

General Relativity can be explained with placing a heavy mass on a fabric sheet. Then the fabric will be curved and any other small mass we put on the fabric sheet will roll down to the heavy mass which is the cause of the curvature.

According to General Relativity a Black Hole is formed when a massive star uses up its nuclear fuel, cools and shrinks below critical size. It will curve space-time so much that anything will be able to escape it because the energy required to escape its pull is termendous.

Black Hole's are cool but how do they affect Determinism. When a particle falls into a Black Hole its information will be lost. The only two charactersitics of a Black Hole that change due to consuming a particle are the mass of the Black Hole and its state of rotaion. Before Hawking Radiation It was thought that the information of a particle that falls into a Black Hole like its position and momentum are not lost they were just inaccessible because they are inside the Black Hole. This was assumed because of the law of the Conservation of Quantum Information (In the quantum world, information cannot be created nor destroyed).

Stephen Hawking described it as the following:

> Out of Sight. Not only do the particles and unlucky astronauts that fall into a black hole, never come out again, but also the information that they carry, is lost forever, at least from our region of the universe.

Before Hawking Radiation was introduced everybody thought Black Holes would exist forever. According Hawking Radiation Black Holes leak there energy and evaporate by radiating particles (photons or other massless particles). When Stephen Hawking combined Quantum Field Theory (QFT) with General Relativity, He found that Black Holes send out radiation at a steady rate.

According to QFT empty space is not really empty it is filled with particles and anti particles that spontaneously appear and imediately annihilate each other. These phenomenon is called **Vacuum Fluctuations**. These pairs of particles are virtual and appear for all elementary particles. They can't be directly messaured using particle detectors. When Vacuum Fluctuations occur near a Black Hole something peculiar happens. When a particle and an anti particle spontaneously appear one of the two might be pulled by the strong gravitational pull of the Black Hole and the other particle would be left free because there is no particle to annihilate with it. These free particles will appear to have been emitted by the Black Hole to a distant observer. These phenomenon is called **Hawking Radiation**.

Hawking Radiation slowly drains the energy of the Black Hole because radiation and emission of particles needs energy. These will make the Black Hole slowly lose its mass and disappear. Hawking Radiation distroys information. The emission produced by a Black Hole is independent of the particle that has fallen into the Black Hole. One of the basic laws of Physics is the conservation of information, information might be mixed up or hidden but it can't be distroyed. In Hawking Radiation information is being destroyed because the Black Hole loses mass but the emitted particles don't contain information prior information prior to thier fall into the Black Hole. What makes the destruction of information distructive to determinism is that in determinism cause and effect are related one causes the other. An effect cannot happen without having a cause. But in the case of Hawking Radiation the cause (a particle falling into a Black Hole) is not related to the effect (an emission produced from the Black Hole). To explain these in mathematical terms for an inverse of a function to be itself a function the original function has to be **one to one**. This means one specific input to the function must produced one specific output. These inhibits Laplace's Demon from turning back the dials of time because It would have no way of knowing what fell into the Black Hole with the information from the emissions produced by the Black Hole. We can conclude that the whole idea of determinism falls apart if information is not conserved.

Laplace's Demon is now incapable of knowing all time. Chaos Theory put limits to its sight. Heisenberg Uncertainty took half of what it can predict. And now Hawking radiation has completely destroyed the idea of a deterministic universe by showing that in exterme condition unpredictablit wins out and determinism is lost.

## Conclusion

The idea of determinism has been regarded as an emotional attachement to control and order in the universe. I don't think that is so because determinism is natural side effect of the way we conduct science. When we conduct experiments we are testing if different initial state give us different final state. By studying the relation between the input and the output. We can reconstruct the transformtions applyed to the initial state to produce the final state. But if the transforms are random and unpredictable then we may never be able to know the terms of our existance. It would mean that we can't light the torch of knowledge in this cave of delusion.
