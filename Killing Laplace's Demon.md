# Killing Laplace's Demon

## Introduction

What are we really doing with this science thing?

To answer this question let's see a very quick summary of the method we use to create science, The Scientific Method.

When we observe a previously unknown phenomenon, we try to explain it using assumptions from our previous knowledge. Then, we transform our initial interpretation into a testable hypothesis. We then test our hypothesis using an experiment. If our hypothesis passes the test, it is considered a model of the phenomenon we observed. Over time as we ask more questions about the phenomenon our model gets more and more complicated. This happens as some things are added, replaced and removed from our model. Or maybe we discover that the phenomenon is just a side effect of a larger process taking place in the background.

The scientific method is the best method we have for acquiring new knowledge. Using the scientific method, we can understand some parts of the universe and incrementaly build upon on the knowledge we acquired to further our understanding even more more. Until we finally understand the whole system. Living in this universe is like being locked in a room while being blind and crippled. Not knowing how we got here, we are just trying to understand our situation. Maybe we try to make a model of the room we’re in using ping pong balls. We can do this by throwing a bunch of balls in every direction and looking at which ones bounce and come back and using this data to make a map of the room we are in. But this can go wrong in many ways. Maybe we didn't throw the balls far enough to bounce off the wall, maybe we forgot to throw one in a specific direction.

In case it wasn’t clear the room is the universe, and the balls are logical questions that help us model our universe.

The scientific method is not perfect. For example, we can't be sure how much our mode of existence affects our observations. We can't be sure of the true nature of reality is captured in our observations. Some scientists question the objectivity of our model of our universe. They ask, Are these models we have developed really defining the objective reality of the universe? Or Are they describing our view of the universe? For example, Niels Bohr insisted that what we actually model is our observations, not the world itself.

> “It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about Nature” – Niels Bohr

The question of the objectivity of our models of the universe becomes very important when we try to use this models of the universe for prediction. Because if these models don’t really describe reality then we have no reason to believe the predictions generated using these models. We have no way of believing that these predictions would in any way be analogous to what is observed in reality. Some scientists question the objectivity of reality, but others are confident of the fact that the universe is objective. They say that the universe is just a state that evolves over time using the laws of physics. This is true to the extent of our current understanding of the universe.

Our laws of nature are just models of the real thing. But we test these models based on how well they predict the next state of the phenomenon they are describing. So if we tested these models of reality based on how well they predict the future. Then what we get at the end is an optimized way of telling the objective future.

Then what we are really doing with this thing we call science is looking through the veils of time to catch a glimpse into the future.

## Determinism

This is not as weird as you might think. Let’s take a look at free-falling bodies, since Galileo Galilei’s discovery that all objects fall to the earth at the same rate we have created formulas with different levels of accuracy that tell us the position of a free falling body at any given time. In today’s world, we depend on our ability to predict the future in many avenues of life. For example, this model of a free-falling body is used in gravity simulation for games and for predicting the motion of spacecraft in continuous orbit.

To predict the motion of a free-falling body all we need to know is the initial height of the ball from the surface of the earth and its initial velocity using these two pieces of information we can calculate the state of the ball at any time in the future or the past.

For example if the position of a free falling body is `2 m` above the surface of the earth and its velocity is `0 m/s` at `t = 0s`. We can calculate what its position and velocity will be at `t = 3s` using the formulas `h(t) = 1/2(g(t^2))` and `v(t) = gt` which as we can see, doesn’t depend on the mass of the object because it is in free fall. So the position and velocity at `t = 3s` is `45 m` and `30 m/s` respectively. But the kicker here is that we can ask what was happening at `t = -2s`. Which would be `20 m` above the initial height of `2 m` and a velocity of `-20 m/s` (the minus shows the direction of the fall).

## Origins

After **Isaac Newton** had published *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in which he formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, people started to realize that this model can be used to calculate the evolution of the position of every particle in the universe. One of the people that came to this realization was **Pierre-Simon Laplace** who introduced a thought experiment to the world in his book *A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities* by stating the following:

> “We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes” - Pierre-Simon Laplace

*The intellect described in this thought experiment is commonly called **Laplace’s Demon**.*

What Laplace is trying to explain here is that according to the physics of his time which is classical physics centered around Newton’s laws of motion. If you could collect the state of every particle in the universe and if you had enough computation power to analyze the data you collected then the past, the future, and everything in between is no longer uncertain because as we saw in the previous example you can turn the dials of time to the extent of your will to see **what had happened in the past** or **what is going to happen** in the future. If you were able to achieve this then time will no longer be a restriction. It would just merely be another variable in your equation.

Note that I said, “**what is going to happen**". You might have sensed a bit of certainty in that statement. In this model of the universe, the universe is void of any uncertainty. If you consider a particle moving through the vacuum of space, its position and its momentum are always known at any point in time. Some of you might be saying what about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, we will get to it in the following sections.

When you combine this with the law of the conservation of mass and the law of the conservation of energy, the universe can be considered a completely adiabatic system in which nothing happening outside it can influence what happens inside it. Anything that exists now existed in some form since the beginning of the universe. You might have heard this before when people say that the oxygen that is today essential to life on our planet was formed in the extreme conditions caused by a dying star.

This view of the universe is called **determinism**.

This can also be considered as a **clockwork universe** in which the universe is considered a perfect machine much like a mechanical clock whose gears are governed by the laws of physics thus making every part of the system predictable. Although Laplace referred to a being when he described his thought experiment, in modern day physics Laplace's Demon is thought of as a computer capable of simulating the universe.

## The Implications

There are a lot of interesting questions that arise when discussing this topic.

* Can you fit all of the information in the universe into a region less than the universe?
* Can you make a computer that can compute the universe while itself being part of that universe?
* How much energy would this computer need?

We will not discuss these questions here, but we will look at the physical models of reality we have today to test if they allow this kind of computer or being to exist. We will contemplate the question **Can Laplace’s Demon Exist?**.

The harshest and possibly the most dangerous implication of determinism is that anything we humans do in this life doesn't matter. We aren't independent actors writing our own stories. We are all actors playing the roles nature wrote for us. The things that happen in life are supposed to happen, and we can't stop them. Murders can not be guilty of their crimes because they were always supposed to kill. People can not be responsible for their actions under determinism. Oedipus was always supposed to kill his father and marry his mother. It is important to remember that you yourself are part of the physical universe, which implies that you, your body, and everything else in the universe follow the same mechanics of the universe that everything else follows. Shortly, you are not immune to the laws of physics. A deterministic universe has no place for **Free Will**. Now that we know what's on the line if Laplace's Demon exists, the proposition of Killing Laplace's Demon becomes very intriguing. Laplace's Demon is a product of a thought experiment. To kill it, we need arguments that contradict its existence.

## The Beasts

Laplace's Demon will face the following three beasts of reason to defend its existence.

1. Chaos Theory
2. Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
3. Black Hole Evaporation (Hawking Radiation)

*These are not all of the arguments against determinism. They are just the ones that are covered here.*

### Chaos Theory

One of the many arguments against the possibility of the existence of Laplace’s Demon is **Chaos Theory**.

Chaos Theory deals with the changes in the final state that result from minor changes in the initial state of a deterministic system. One example is the **Butterfly Effect** which states that A butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could cause a tornado in Texas. Everything in the world is connected. Because of this, one could never know the full effects of even the tiniest of forces or lack thereof. Even the small force from a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil might affect the molecules around the butterfly, starting a chain reaction that eventually causes a tornado in Texas. This theory states that tiny differences in initial conditions, such as those caused by errors in measurement or calculation, can yield widely diverging results in the final state.

Measurement is always limited by the measuring device. For example, any measurement made with a regular ruler is limited by the ruler's scale, which is approximately `1 mm`. When using a ruler with a scale of `1 mm`, there is an implicit uncertainty of `0.5 mm` in your measurements. The actual value of a measurement such as `2.1 cm` is somewhere between `2.05 cm` and `2.15 cm`. Even if you use a laser beam for your measurement, you would be restricted by the wavelength of the laser and a host of other factors. Although we can never get rid of it, we can always minimize the uncertainty in our measurement using a more accurate measuring device.

Laplace’s Demon needs to be able to collect every particle in the universe's position and momentum to infinite precision. This is not possible due to the limits set by chaos theory. Even if the universe is deterministic, Laplace's Demon cannot predict the future until the end of time. Alternatively, it can't look back to the past until the beginning of time. Because the butterfly effect creeps into our computation after some steps in the simulation of the universe, it impedes our ability to predict the future with certainty.

Chaos theory doesn’t completely rule out the possibility of the existence of Laplace’s Demon. It simply limits the demon's ability to view the future and the past. Chaos theory is like a fog that sets in when we look too far into the future or too far back to the past. Chaos theory tells us that even if the universe is deterministic we can’t look at all of time at the same time.

The effects of chaos theory are quite predictable when you consider the inherent inaccuracy of all measurements. For example, if we are continuously squaring a number, our uncertainty gets bigger and bigger with each evolution until our measurements are no longer useful. When measured with a ruler of uncertainty `0.05 mm`, our initial state is `2.0 cm`. So, our actual value is somewhere between `1.95 cm` and `2.05 cm`. We will get the following

```
initial state = 2.0 ± 0.05 cm = 2.4 ± 2.5%
1st evolution = (2.0 ± 2.5%) * 2 = 4.0 ± 5.0%
2nd evolution = (4.0 ± 5.0%) * 2 = 16.0 ± 10.0%
3rd evolution = (16.0 ± 10.0%) * 2 = 256.0 ± 20.0%
4th evolution = (256.0 ± 20.0%) * 2 = 65,536.0 ± 40.0%
```

In the process of evolving the state, the uncertainties become bigger and bigger, making our predictions less and less reliable.

### Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

The next beast Laplace’s Demon has to face is the beast of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, which states that you can’t measure both the position and momentum (velocity) of a particle exactly at the same time.

I realize that through out this essay i have been referring to **some particles** the reason forthis ambiguity is, throughout history as this deterministic view of our universe evolved. Scientists have been learning a lot about the fundamental particles of nature. Because of this different scientists that worked on this problem used the word particle to mean different things. Before modern particle physics the particles that were referred to might have been some sort indivisible small material or materials that constitute everything in the universe. In modern science thy are the particles of the standard model. The **Standard Model** of particle physics is the theory describing **three of the four known fundamental forces** in the universe and **twelve elementary particles**. Gravity remains unexplained by this model. If you are talking about determinism in terms of the standard model, you are asking if the interactions between the fundamental forces and the elementary particles are unpredictable or random in anyway. Some say that even the standard model is not fundamental enough by pointing to its shortcomings in explaining gravity. In Laplace’s Demon there is an implicit assumption that the most fundamental thing that constitutes everything in the universe is some sort of particle, but there are other modern theories of everything or theories of determinism that consider other things as fundamental. For example in **string theory** the most fundamental things from which everything is made up from are *infinitesimal vibrating strings*, there are also some theories that that propose that the most fundamental thing in the universe is **binary information** (**1s** and **0s**). In this essay I have been using the word particle to mean the most fundamental thing in the theory we are discussing. In this specific case we are considering the elementary particles of the standard model mainly the electron.

This beast tries to disadvantage Laplace’s Demon by affecting its power to observe. In any form of seeing whether it is using (light, sound or something else) some wave or particle has to propagate through the space between the observer and the subject and then bounce of the surface of the subject to get back to the observer at which point the observer can note which ones came back and use that to form an image. Here you should realize that the source of illumination doesn’t necessarily have to begin its trajectory from the observer. That is the particle or wave we are using doesn’t necessarily have to originate from the observer.

Let’s see an example, when you are seeing something a light source whether it is the sun or simply a torch light illuminates the subject you are observing with photons these photos start their journey from the light source, travel through space between the light source and subject. After that they hit the subject, the photons bounce back in each and every different directions and some get into your eyes and form an image.

Observing although commonly not thought of us a physical process, has side effects on the physical universe. Meaning that if the subject you are observing is small enough to be affected by the particle or the wave your observation mechanism is using then it will be. Observation is snapshot of the state of the subject before the effects of the observation take place. Observation alter the state of the subject.

If we are using light waves to the observe the position of an electron then that electron’s velocity will be affected by the observation because a photon just collided with which means its observed state is out of sync with the state it is in the real world. If we had known the velocity of the electron before the collision then we don’t know now.

In order to observe something as small us an electron, we need a light with a very small wavelength. When we decrease the wavelength of a light then we are inadvertently going to increase the frequency. The higher your frequency the more energetic the wave is. Due to this our light will have more energy. This will cause the electron’s velocity to be even more greatly affected. The more accurately we try to observer the position of a particle (i.e by decreasing the wavelength) the more the velocity of the particle is affected making our knowledge of its velocity less accurate.

Heisenberg was able to realize this fundamental limit on observation set by nature. He found the limit for this inaccuracy to be plank’s constant divided by the mass of the particle. Laplace’s Demon needs knowledge over every particle’s position and momentum (i.e is mass times velocity) to do its predictions but Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle has taken that away.

Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle has gored out Laplace’s Demon's eyes making it incapable of total knowledge. Making it impossible to know the position and momentum of every particle in the universe.

There are two arguments that suport the legitimacy of Laplace’s Demon.

Argument number one is even if Laplace’s Demon is not able to record the position and momentum of every particle in the universe, it can still generate a random initial state and evolve that state to see where it goes. Although this will mean that Laplace’s Demon will not be able to look at the past and the future of our universe at the same It will however be able to see the past and the future of the universe that originates from the random state it generated. This is all to mean that even if Laplace’s Demon is not able to simulate our universe it will be able to simulate a universe the evolves from its own initial arbitrary random state.

Argument number two is to that we are not sure if electrons are the most fundamental thing. In order to simulate a system you need to know what the most fundamental pieces of that system that make it work. For example in string theory the most fundamental things in universe are infinitesimal vibrating strings. According some scientists the most fundamental thing in the universe is **information**. We will cover these ideas another time.

This is the origin of one of Albert Einstein’s famous quote “God doesn’t play dice with the universe”. Which illustrates the frustrations many scientists have with uncertainty. Einstein was a proponent of Laplacian determinism. Einstein thought that the uncertainty we observe is because of our view of the universe. He thought that the underlying reality of the universe as perceived through a power such as God (which he meant to say an omnipotent being outside of the universe that is able to see into the universe) would have no place for uncertainty.

-- Talk about the wave function

The wave function contains all that one can know of the particle, both its position, and its speed. If you know the wave function at one time, then its values at other times are determined by what is called the Schroedinger equation. Thus one still has a kind of determinism, but it is not the sort that Laplace envisaged. Instead of being able to predict the positions and speeds of particles, all we can predict is the wave function. This means that we can predict just half what we could, according to the classical 19th century view.

-- From <https://www.hawking.org.uk/in-words/lectures/does-god-play-dice>

Laplace’s Demon has been badly wounded after its face down with Chaos Theory and Heisenberg’s  Uncertainty Principle.

Chaos Theory took its ability to have infinite knowledge. It also draw curtains of ambiguity thereby limiting Laplace's Demon’s ability to see into the past and the future without bounds.

And now Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle has made Laplace's Demon incapable of observing (with any level of certainty) the position and momentum of every particle in the universe. The only thing Laplace’s Demon can do now is look at small chunks of the past and the future of a universe that has evolved from an initial configuration determined by it self. Laplace's Demon is now unable to simulate the universe it exists in.

The final beast Laplace’s Demon has to face is Black Hole Radiation. Let’s see if this is the last argument against Laplace’s Demon’s plea for existence.

### Black Hole Evaporation (Hawking Radiation)

A black hole is a celestial structure with a strong gravitational field such that anything that descends into it would not be able to escape. Black Holes are very dense. They have a large amount of mass and a small volume.

Laplace wrote a paper in 1799 describing a gravitational field that is so strong that light itself wouldn't escape its grasp. Before Laplace, a scientist called John Mitchell also wrote about this phenomenon. Light was considered to have been made up of particles called **corpuscles**. In 1887 Michelson and Morley showed that light always traveled at a speed of `300,000 km/s` independent of its origins. This disproved the theory that light could be slowed down by a strong gravitational field. In 1915 when Einstein published his revolutionary paper on the **General Theory of Relativity**. In this theory space and time are not separate entities. They were just two directions in a single object called **space-time**. Space-time is curved and warped by the matter and energy in it. This curvature is explained to be **Gravity**. The General Theory of Relativity dictates that everything follows a straight line in the fabric of space-time. Therefore when an object of some mass curves space-time everything including light, moons, stars, planets, and other celestial objects follow the path formed by the curvature. In 1919 Einstein's theory was proven to be correct by observing the shift of light that was caused by the curved space-time around the sun, measured during an eclipse in West Africa. This revived the previously disproved theory that a gravitational field with sufficient strength could bend light. These celestial structures that have tremendous gravitational strength are called **Black Holes**.

The General Theory of Realtivity can be explained using this analogy. When a heavy mass is placed on a fabric sheet, the fabric will be curved around the mass. Any other mass we put on the fabric sheet will roll down to the heavy mass.

Black Hole is formed when a massive star uses up all its nuclear fuel, cools down, and shrinks below its critical size. Due to the enormous amount of energy required to escape, anything that falls into a Black Hole will be unable to escape.

Black Holes sound cool, but how do they affect Determinism?

When a particle falls into a Black Hole, all its information is lost. The only two characteristics of a Black Hole that change due to consuming a particle are the mass of the Black Hole and its state of rotation. Before the theory of Black Hole Radiation, It was thought that the information of a particle that falls into a Black Hole like its position and momentum are not lost they were just inaccessible because they are inside the Black Hole. This was presumed because of the law of the Conservation of Quantum Information (In the quantum world, information cannot be created nor destroyed).

Stephen Hawking said the following about this phenomenon.

> "Out of Sight. Not only do the particles and unlucky astronauts that fall into a black hole, never come out again, but also the information that they carry, is lost forever, at least from our region of the universe."

Before the discovery of Black Hole Radiation, everybody thought Black Holes would exist forever. All that was changed when Stephen Hawking combined **Quantum Field Theory** (QFT) with the **General theory of Relativity**. He found that Black Holes send out radiation at a steady rate. The discovery of Black Hole Radiation (Hawking Radiation) showed that Black Holes leak their energy and evaporate by radiating particles. Hawking Radiation slowly drains the energy of the Black Hole due to the energy needed for radiation of particles. These will make the Black Hole lose its mass and disappear.

According to QFT empty space is not really empty. It is filled with particles and anti-particles that spontaneously appear and immediately collide and annihilate each other. This phenomenon is called **Vacuum Fluctuations**. These pairs of particles are virtual and appear for all elementary particles. They can't be directly measured using particle detectors. When Vacuum Fluctuations occur near a Black Hole, something peculiar happens. When a particle and an anti-particle simultaneously appear, one of them might be pulled into the Black Hole. The other particle would be left free because there is no particle to annihilate with it. These free particles will then move out into space. These free particle will appear to have been emitted by the Black Hole to a distant observer. This phenomenon is called **Black Hole (Hawking) Radiation**.

Hawking Radiation destroys information. The radiation produced by a Black Hole is independent of the particles that have fallen into the Black Hole. One of the basic laws of physics is the **conservation of information**. This conservation rule states that information might be mixed up or hidden, but can't be destroyed. The theory of Hawking Radiation violates this rule.

A Black Hole loses mass due to Hawking Radiation, but the radiations produced by the Black Hole contain no information about the particles that had fallen into the Black Hole. Where do the particles that had fallen into the Black Hole go when the Black Hole disappears? This is widely considered one of the great unsolved paradoxes of Physics. Stephen Hawking was able to use **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)** which clearly states that quantum information can't be destroyed, to conclude that information can be destroyed under extreme conditions such as the **Death of a Black Hole**.

The destruction of information is detrimental to determinism. In determinism cause and effect must be related to each other. An effect cannot happen without a cause. In the theory of Hawking Radiation, the cause (a particle falling into a Black Hole) is not related to the effect (radiation produced from the Black Hole).

In mathematical terms, for an inverse of a function to be itself a function the original function has to be **one-to-one**. A one-to-one function is a function in which one specific input produces one specific output. The paradox of Hawking Radiation stops the universe's mechanics from being one-to-one the output (the radiation) was not specific to the input (the particle). Many different particles with different initial states fall into the Black Hole, but the radiation produced is the same for all of them. This makes Laplace's Demon incapable of turning back the dials of time because It would have no way of knowing what fell into the Black Hole with the information from the radiations produced by the Black Hole.

Laplace's Demon is now incapable of knowing all time. Chaos Theory put limits to its sight. Heisenberg Uncertainty took half of what it can predict. And now Hawking Radiation has destroyed the idea of a deterministic universe by showing that in extreme conditions unpredictability wins out and determinism is lost. The paradox of the Death of a Black Hole kills Laplace's Demon.

## Conclusion

In the Introduction section, It was mentioned that science is dependent on the universe being objective. If you treat the universe as a black box that takes in an input and produces an output. Essentially how experimentation works, which we heavily depend on for acquiring knowledge, is the experimenters provide input for the black box and record the output. They do this again and again until they have enough data to reverse engineer the process that takes place inside the black box. Our universe interpedeted under determininisim and is analogous to the black box. It always produces the same output for a specific input. If determinism is proven to be false, we can no longer be certain that the universe doesn't produce the same states under the same conditions. This will render all the knowledge we have acquired from experimentation false. The patterns we saw in nature will all just have been illusions. If we can't test that a specific input gives a specific output then we can't check if our hypothesis are right. Determinism is not about the dream of simulating the universe. It is about the hope that our quest for knowledge can bring us closer to the truth. It is about the belief that the universe is objective. If we finally understand how it works, We will be to know the **circumstances of our existence**.

The idea of determinism has been regarded as an emotional attachment to control and order in the universe. I don't think that is true because determinism is the natural side effect of the way we conduct science. A random universe is much scarier than a deterministic universe. I don't think people realize that. The main reason people fear determinism is that under it people wouldn't be responsible for their actions. It would mean that we are all puppets controlled by the grand calculus of the universe. It would mean that we have no control over our fates. It would mean that we are active actors in our lives but passive observers of what has already been decided. On the other hand, determinism allows us to see the strings. In determinism, we can make models of the universe and test their validity, and trust the results of our experiments. Randomness, while giving us freedom and the burden of responsibility, it takes a tremendous sacrifice. We must sacrifice our belief that there is a correlation between cause and effect. Randomness would mean that what happens before is not in any way able to affect what happens after. Theories produced using the scientific method would be no more truthful than their religious or cultural counterparts. We can't definitively know anything about a random universe. A random universe would mean that, we can't light the torch of knowledge in this cave of delusion.

 Hoping for a day when we can say we understand this room we are stuck in. This has been the memorial for Laplace's Demon.
